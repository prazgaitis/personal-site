I am a Senior Software Engineer living in Chicago. I like making things and
teaching others to do the same. Sometimes its with code, other times with wood
and a saw, and sometimes it's hot sauce. ðŸŒ¶

I used to work at <a href="https://vsco.co">VSCO</a>,<a
href="https://www.braintreepayments.com">Braintree</a>, and <a
href="https://www.jazz.co">the Resumator (now Jazz)</a> before that.

I studied Computer Science at the <a href="https://www.uchicago.edu">University of Chicago</a>, and Marketing & Economics at <a href="https://www.pitt.edu">Pitt</a>. I grew up in Philadelphia - home of Ben Franklin and cheesesteaks.
