I am a software developer in Chicago. I enjoy reading, fitness, and making hot sauce.

Currently, I work at <a href="https://www.braintreepayments.com">Braintree</a> in Chicago. Before that, I worked at <a href="https://www.jazz.co">the Resumator</a> in Pittsburgh. 

I studied Computer Science at the <a href="https://www.uchicago.edu">University of Chicago</a>, and Marketing & Economics at <a href="https://www.pitt.edu">Pitt</a>. I grew up in Philadelphia - home of Ben Franklin and cheesesteaks.
