    <h1>Bookshelf</h1>
    <p>
        Inspired by <a href="http://jasdev.me/bookshelf/">Jasdev Singh</a>,
        <a href="https://patrickcollison.com/bookshelf">Patrick Collison</a>
        and others, here is a list of books that I have in my digital or analog
        bookshelf. I have read most of the titles listed here, or plan on
        reading them shortly. Hopefully you can use this as a place to find a
        recommendation when you need a new book!
