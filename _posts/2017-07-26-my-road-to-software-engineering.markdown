TL;DR

I recently started my first real programming job at Braintree Payments. Before this, I worked at various startups in non-technical roles.

Like a lot of other college freshmen, I had no idea what sort of career goals I had, or even was supposed to have. Sure, there is pressure to aspire to join the ranks of Doctors, Lawyers, or other prestigious jobs so that your parents can brag to their friends.

> 2010: freshman year of college
> Career aspiration: ???

I didn't know how to pick, so I ended up joining the business school, but also taking some Biology classes to keep those med-school options open. (waste of time)

You're not going to find good goals by thinking about it and making a list. The best way is to go experience things, meet people, take internships and try your hand at as many things as possible.

I finally discovered what I wanted to do when I learned about startups. A young, slightly disheveled guy from a local startup came in to give a presentation in my Intro to Marketing class. I totally forget the content of the talk, but I do remember that he opened up with [Dollar Shave Club's famous video ad.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZUG9qYTJMsI)

> 2012: Sophomore year of college
> Career aspiration: Something at Startups!

This was eye opening. You mean to tell me that "business" isn't always conducted in stuffy boardrooms and cubicles? A whole new world opened up! I was hooked from the beginning. After the talk, I approached the speaker and gushed about something or other, and then shortly after applied for a job at his company, the Resumator. I was rejected. 

I didn't know anything about programming, but I knew that I needed to get into a startup and find out more. Eventually I did end up getting a job at the Resumator as a Customer Success Intern. I did a lot of grunt work, some reporting on customer success metrics, and some spreadsheets about which customers were _dunning_ or hadn't paid their bills that month. This whole time, I was interested in Sales, because it seemed exciting. 

> 2013: junior year of college
> Career goal: Startup Sales!

The Resumator continued growing fast and sales turnover was high. It took a while to find out who our ideal customer was, the Sales process was tough, and the competitors kept getting better. It was modeled on a book called [Predictable Revenue](http://amzn.to/2vNsa9L), which details how SalesForce (the original SaaS company) grew to $100 million in revenue. The strategy involves getting (or buying) a whole lot of leads, sending them emails to gauge interest, and convincing people to watch a demo of your software.

It's mainly a numbers game - more demos equals more sales. Entry level sales people (SDR's) hammer through a list of leads via phone and email to to book demos. The Account Executives take it from there and try to close the deal.

Around this same time I started a business called PittMom.com. It was a pickup & delivery laundry service on Pitt's campus. I had a blast making the website, launching the business, and growing it. I hired my roommates and some friends to do the laundry, and I focused on acquiring customers and polishing up the website. Getting the first customer (a person I did not know) was one of the most exhillarating experiences of my life. We weren't making barely any money, but running a real business sure was fun!

> September 2013: almost done college
> Career Goal: Startup founder, Freelance developer

I made friends with some of the developers at the Resumator, and I was learning to code on Treehouse, Codecademy, and any other online resource I could find. I considered delaying graduation to get a degree in Computer Science at Pitt, but I was already halfway out the door to real life, I was working full-time, and I figured I could probably learn most of the stuff online.

> May 2014: job change!
> Career aspiration: Software Engineering is hard. Maybe tech support or Sales Engineer?

I got a job at Braintree Payments in Chicago
